GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU (4.0 GB)

RANKING BY ROC-AUC:
-------------------
1. RandomForest    ROC-AUC: 0.881  Accuracy: 77.2%  Time: 0.8s  Device: CPU  
2. XGBoost         ROC-AUC: 0.871  Accuracy: 79.1%  Time: 2.8s  Device: GPU  GPU: 84%
3. GPCNN           ROC-AUC: 0.821  Accuracy: 61.2%  Time: 4.4s  Device: GPU  GPU: 100%
4. NeuralNet       ROC-AUC: 0.820  Accuracy: 75.3%  Time: 0.6s  Device: GPU  GPU: 7%
5. SimpleMLP       ROC-AUC: 0.661  Accuracy: 50.7%  Time: 0.0s  Device: GPU  

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
1. Random Forest (CPU) achieved best ROC-AUC (0.881) without GPU
2. XGBoost showed real GPU utilization at 84%
3. GP+CNN used 100% GPU but underperformed due to feature mismatch
4. Small neural networks showed minimal GPU benefit
5. Tree-based models excel on tabular TSFresh features

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
- For TSFresh features: Use Random Forest (CPU)
- For GPU deployment: Use XGBoost with gpu_hist
- For raw light curves: GP+CNN would be optimal
- For production: Ensemble RF + XGBoost

GPU UTILIZATION SUMMARY:
------------------------
- XGBoost: 84% (excellent GPU usage)
- GP+CNN: 100% (saturated GPU)
- Neural Net: 7% (minimal usage)
- Simple MLP: 0% (no benefit)
- Random Forest: CPU only

CONCLUSION:
-----------
Model selection > Hardware acceleration for this dataset.
Random Forest proves CPU can beat GPU when algorithm matches data type.
