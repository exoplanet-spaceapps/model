## Key Findings

### 1. Winner: XGBoost
- **Best Overall Performance:** ROC-AUC 0.879
- **Highest Accuracy:** 81.0%
- **Best F1 Score:** 0.833
- **GPU Acceleration:** Successfully utilized gpu_hist tree method

### 2. Why XGBoost Outperformed CNN

**Data Characteristics:**
- **Small Dataset:** Only 1,866 samples (1,266 training)
- **Tabular Features:** 785 pre-engineered TSFresh statistical features
- **High Dimensionality:** 785 features vs 1,266 training samples

**XGBoost Advantages:**
1. **Better for Tabular Data:** Gradient boosting excels with structured/tabular features
2. **Feature Engineering:** TSFresh features are already optimized statistics
3. **Small Data Efficiency:** Tree-based models handle small datasets better than deep learning
4. **Regularization:** Built-in L1/L2 regularization prevents overfitting

**Neural Network Challenges:**
1. **Data Hunger:** CNNs typically need >10K samples for optimal performance
2. **Overfitting:** NN showed early stopping at epoch 22 due to validation loss increase
3. **Feature Type:** Pre-computed statistics don't benefit from CNN's pattern recognition
4. **Architecture Mismatch:** 1D-CNN designed for raw time series, not statistical features

### 3. Model-Specific Insights

**Random Forest (2nd Place)**
- Fastest training: 0.8 seconds
- Near-best performance: ROC-AUC 0.876
- Best recall: 94.1%
- CPU-only but highly competitive

**Improved Neural Network**
- GPU acceleration effective: 2.1s training
- Early stopping prevented overfitting
- 4-layer architecture with BatchNorm and GELU
- Dropout regularization (0.3, 0.2, 0.1)

**Simple MLP (Baseline)**
- Minimal architecture: 3 layers only
- Poor generalization: 68% accuracy
- Fastest inference: 0.1s training
- Shows importance of model complexity

## GPU Utilization Analysis

| Model | GPU Usage | Speedup | Memory |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| XGBoost | gpu_hist | ~2-3x | Moderate |
| Neural Network | CUDA | Full GPU | Low |
| Random Forest | N/A (CPU) | - | - |
| Simple MLP | CUDA | Full GPU | Minimal |

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
1. **Primary Model:** Deploy XGBoost for best accuracy
2. **Backup Model:** Use Random Forest for CPU-only environments
3. **Ensemble Option:** Combine XGBoost + Random Forest predictions

### For Future Improvements
1. **Data Augmentation:** Generate synthetic samples to reach >10K training examples
2. **Feature Selection:** Reduce from 785 to top 100-200 features
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid search for XGBoost parameters
4. **Raw Time Series:** Try CNN on original light curves instead of TSFresh features

## Conclusion

The GPU training comparison demonstrates that **gradient boosting (XGBoost) remains superior for small, tabular datasets** even with GPU acceleration. The pre-engineered TSFresh features (785 statistical metrics) are optimally utilized by tree-based models rather than deep learning architectures.

For this exoplanet detection task with limited training data (1,266 samples), XGBoost achieves the best balance of:
- High accuracy (81.0%)
- Strong generalization (ROC-AUC 0.879)
- Reasonable training time (4.0s with GPU)

The neural network approaches showed promise but require more data to reach their full potential. With the current dataset size and feature engineering, **XGBoost is the recommended model for deployment**.
